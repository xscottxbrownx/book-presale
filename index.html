        <h2>Excerpt</h2>
        <p class="excerpt">This is the day, the hour, the moment. After months of this, I am lying in the same white windowless room. I keep my body still with my palms up at my sides. The nurse dressed in a hooded white suit attaches the last of the sensors to my chest. With a series of clicks the machines hum to life. My heartbeats are mimicked in beeps and she studies a wall of screens to be sure I'm fit enough to endure this again.</p>
        <p>"Mr. Sutter, how many times have you been through the consciousness displacement?"</p>
        <p>"Four."</p>
        <p>"Any problems we should be aware of: shortness of breath, chest pain, loss of appetite?"</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"Okay," she scans her clipboard to be sure she hasn't missed anything, "So you know how it works then. For the time you are gone-"</p>
        <p>"Yes, yes. My soul will leave. My body stays. I got it." She lifts her eyes from her clipboard to look at me with a stern gaze. I've done it again. Scientists don't appreciate words like "soul" and she missed my air quotes.</p>
        <p>"We do not advocate the idea or existence of a soul, Mr. Sutter. It is merely your consciousness we are transferring. This is a very serious process. You will be legally brain dead for a matter of twenty to forty minutes. I must remind you that this is still just a study."</p>
        <p>"Of course." I keep my eyes on the ceiling.</p>
        <p>"According to your chart, you will be reaching for nine years this time."</p>
        <p><em>Finally.</em> A knot forms in my stomach and I ache excitedly at the confirmation.</p>
        <p>"Once again, Mr. Sutter, I am required to inform you that you will be bound by the actual events of the time.  No one has successfully broken from the original experiences, but we encourage you to try in only a very small way. The purpose of the study is not to change your past, but to test the possibilities of this process." She reads the speech from her clipboard in a monotone voice, like she's reading instructions on how to operate a toaster.</p>
        <p>I've been waiting too long. I refuse to accept something as impossible just because it hasn't been done before. If I didn’t believe in pushing limits, I wouldn’t be their lab rat.</p>
        <p>"I understand." I tell her, masking my eagerness.</p>
        <p>"Do you have any questions?"</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"We'll get started then." Turning her back to me, she busies herself at the screens. When she is finished, she fits an oxygen mask on my face that obscures my vision as she begins the IV drip. I watch as best I can as the blue liquid trickles down the thin tube to meet my arm. I close my eyes, but not voluntarily. I let out a breath and it feels like my last as everything goes dark.</p><br>
        <p>From the hilltop I gaze out over orange orchards and ever-expanding suburbs. A mix of dust and pollution make an abrupt horizon. I imagine a hundred years ago I may have been able to see the land go on forever, alive with ancient oak trees and wildlife. Today it is all track housing, dairies, and farmland; in fifteen years it will be abandoned dead land, too barren to sustain life. The late summer evening grows cooler as the sun sets and I pull at the zipper of my sweatshirt, just as I did the first time I lived this day.</p>
        <p>I used to visit this place when I needed to clear my head, but this day is different and I can't remember why. I look up to the boulders at the very top of the hill and start to make my way over the cow-trampled field when I finally feel her hand in mine. I want to hold my breath in anticipation until I look back to see her.</p>
        <p>“I still don't see why we had to walk from the very bottom. We could have parked right outside the gate," she complains, as I pull her along.</p>
        <p>“You have to earn the view.” I had told her. I say my line flawlessly, suddenly spinning her around in my arms to look over the warm glow of the brilliant orange sky.</p>
        <p>“I'm going to get out of here first chance I get.” Her tone is solemn and cuts through me with it's implications.</p>
        <p><em>You have to.</em> I want to say it, but I'm trapped. I want to brush her dark hair out of her face, but I'm bound. I want to kiss her, but I never could.</p>
        <p>I look down to see her eyes and relief washes over me. They're everything I remember, brilliant blue and deep with sorrow. I know it's coming, but my heart falters when she looks back and her expression changes into something else; something that was only for me. I loved the way she always looked at me like I was the single most fantastic creature on earth, but this time I know I don't deserve it. I feel the moment coming when I'll look away and I uselessly try to fight it.</p>
        <p>I am running out of time and I feel it.</p>
        <p><em>I will always be yours. Please don't forget that.</em></p><br>
        <p>I hear the beeping of my monitored heartbeats and I squeeze my eyelids together tightly.</p>
        <p>"That wasn't long enough."</p>
        <p>"It's not an exact science yet, Mr. Sutter. Please lie still." She is checking my blood pressure.</p>
        <p>"I couldn't..." I stop myself. If they find out why I'm here, I'll be removed from the program. I concentrate on slowing my heart rate and evening my breaths.</p>
        <p>"They will record your results during your evaluation after you are medically cleared. Please stay still and don't try to talk yet."</p>
        <p>My eyes are hot when I open them to the blinding present.</p>
